Renthop-Scrapy

This spider scrapes Renthop, a real estate listing service in New York City, and returns information on all the agents that are 
advertising on the website.

Getting Started

This project is improvement on my Renthop-Scraper project (see my other repositories), utilizing Python's Scrapy module. Just as the 
RH-Scraper was my first project with LXML, RH-Scrapy is my first project with the module Scrapy.
